## This is for question 3.60

you can clone and run it by command
```shell
git clone https://github.com/dupeiran001/csapp/
cd csapp/CHapter3_homework/
cd p312_3.60
make
```
this requires that you have an objdump and a vi editor
it can directly show the disassemble result of src.o  
(src.o is the compile result of src.c)

also you can use
```shell
make asm
```
to see the direct gcc -S result

then use
```shell
make clean
```
to clean the files

### src.c is the answer of the question 
### disassemble.txt is the objdump result of src.o
### questionsrc.txt is the objdump result of the question proved asm code
